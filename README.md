analysis of compressive sensing in wireless sensor network
Here 3 segment basically- 
(1) SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF COMPRESSIVE SENSING (by taking an example of sinusoidal signal)
(2) Analysis of different measurement matrix in compressive sensing (my image is input for compression and reconstruction) 
(3) Application of compressive sensing technique in wireless sensor network (using leach cluster techniques) 
Then result is showing in document that is uploaded to link 2 (named pwc2017002.pdf)
In result, i am successfully reconstructing compressed data with less error.
